# Sportsvidclassifier

This project involves the classification of sports videos using feature extraction and skeletonization,
fine-tuning the YOLOv5 model to predict around five categories of sports. Skeletonization was done
with the help of the Mediapipe library, and OpenCV was used for processing the sports videos and
converting them into frames.
